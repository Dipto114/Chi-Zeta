              We are proud to be part of the history of Alpha Kappa Psi, both here at NJIT and around the world.
              Alpha Kappa Psi is a co-ed professional fraternity dedicated to developing principled business leaders.
              We emphasize five core values: brotherhood, knowledge, integrity, service, and unity.
              These values make up everything that we do as an organization and individuals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Making the decision to become involved in Alpha Kappa Psi has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my college career thus far.
              As an active founding member, I learned the inner workings of establishing an organization from the ground up.
              This fraternity has shown me what it is like to be a part of something so much bigger than myself, while also helping me realize how much I can contribute as an individual.
              Not only have I made lifelong friendships and indelible memories, but I am confident that I am better prepared for life after college.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am incredibly proud of our chapter for accomplishing so many milestones this past year.
              Moreover, I am honored to be the president of an organization of such inspiring, loyal, and dedicated individuals.
              I am grateful to call these people my Brothers.
            </p>
            <p>
              On behalf of this brotherhood here at Chi Zeta, I invite you to look through our site and learn about all the benefits our organization has to offer.
              Please do not hesitate to reach out to us, and we hope you will continue to learn more and join us at a future rush event.
            </p>
